# Stay-at-Home-memory-game

Find the pair! that's the goal of this game that will give you some ideas of what to do during this difficult crisis, with a big part of the world in lockdown and not knowing what to do with their time.

- Click two consecutive cards and find if they are a match.
- When every card has been turned, a message will appaear indicating you have won.
- There is a Start Again button to reset the game at any point.

The website has been made with Html5, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. 

I followed the Code Sketch tutorial [Learn Vanilla Javascript: Memory Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMhiMsEC9Uk&list=WL&index=9&t=0s) as well as other personal resources. 

These are some of the interesting concepts that I have learnt or practised here:
- different properties of [classList](https://alligator.io/js/classlist/).
- the keyword [this](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp).
- [data-* attribute](https://www.sitepoint.com/how-why-use-html5-custom-data-attributes/) and dataset property.
- [location.realod()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_loc_reload.asp) method.
- [setTimeout()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp) method.
- [Style order](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_style_order.asp) property.
- [removeEventListener](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_removeeventlistener.asp) method.
- [backface-visibility](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/backface-visibility/) CSS property.
